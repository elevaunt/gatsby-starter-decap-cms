        Lee & Amanda were turned onto the personal development space over 15
        years ago, and have been fascinated by the power of the mind ever
        since.  Lee learned first hand the power of life coaching when he hired
        a personal life coach and tripled his income in 3 years.


        Later, Amanda built a business in the health and wellness space where she helped hundreds of individuals not only improve their physical health, but also their mental health.  Together, Amanda and Lee spoke at events, provided personal coaching, and trained hundreds as they also built their own businesses.


        In 2020, they were introduced to Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) and quickly recognized that the tools available through NLP were the key to creating lasting change for individuals.  They both became certified as Practitioners and Master Practitioners and have effectively helped business owners and those looking to level up their lives to reach their full potential.

        You don't need more willpower to make significant change.  But instead,
        **you need tools** to help you change your programming (habits). 


        So instead of continuing an internal struggle that seems like it may never end, or deciding to just give up, how much better would it be to learn how to reprogram your brain **to get the results you want?**


        We can teach you the tools and skills you need to clean out your past, design your future, and **create the reality you truly want**.
