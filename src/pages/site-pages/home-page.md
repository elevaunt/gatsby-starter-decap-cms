        We’ve been there, we know the struggle and the pain that can persist
        with a porn habit. We know the heartache it can cause.\

        \

        We've also spent hundreds of hours learning about how the brain works and how to program the results you want!  We are Master Practitioners in Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP).  What does this mean for you? \

        \

        We know how to help you CHANGE your mind!\

        \

        We have found tools that worked for us to finally find peace and healing from the problems that come from pornography use.\

        \

        Now we want to share what we’ve learned with you, so you can experience the hope and joy that comes from healing and living in alignment with your values.

            Unsure of what you will do if your kid comes with questions about
            sex or you discover a history of inappropriate online searches?
            Maybe you hoped your online filters would create safety only to find
            out kids at school talked about or showed your child something.


            * ​**Unsure** of what to say and how to get started

            * ​**Afraid** of creating too much curiosity

            * ​​**Uncomfortable** speaking about pornography / sexuality

            * **​Don’t know what to do** besides external filters

            Maybe you've been viewing porn for decades, maybe it's only been a short while.  Regardless of how long it's been, maybe you are experiencing some of the same feelings we did for years. Can you relate?


            * ​**Frustrated** because you've wanted to quit but don't know how

            * ​**Hopeless**, you've tried everything you can think of but nothing has worked

            * ​​**Feeling terrible** about yourself every time you view porn

            * ​**Scared** you may lose all you hold dear

        You don't need more willpower to quit porn.  But instead, **you need
        tools** to help you change your programming (habits).  You're brain and
        body are actually doing what they are supposed to do. \

        \

        So instead of continuing an internal struggle that seems like it may never end, or deciding to just give up, how much better would it be to learn how to reprogram your brain **to get the results you want?** \

        \

        We can teach you the tools and skills you need so you can finally find healing for yourself, your relationships, and all other areas of your life - **shame free!**
